                    <p>Becky was born in Boston, MA and grew up outside of Providence, RI (about 50 miles southwest of Boston). She loves having 4 seasons (although sometimes she could do without winter) and she loves having a Dunkin around every corner - but definitely does NOT like trying to drive in Boston!</p>
